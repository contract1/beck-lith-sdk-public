Compiling quantum-resistant token contract...
✅ Contract compiled successfully

Deploying BECK-LITH protected ERC-827 token...
⚠️  Prototype mode: PQC verification layer active (Hyperledger Fabric)
✅ BECK-LITH SDK activated — quantum-resistant signature engine online

⚠️  QUANTUM THREAT (Standard ERC-827)

Attack vector: Shor's Algorithm on ECDSA
Risk level: CRITICAL — private key extraction in <8 hours
Result: Funds compromised — NO quantum resistance
